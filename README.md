# cnn-dropout
Update of the theano code for a CNN to implement dropout and filter visualization.

Read the ipython notebook cnn-scyfer-project.ipynb to follow a tutorial-like document on the implementation of dropout on a pre-existing theano based code of a convolutional neural networks.

The toy data set used is MNIST digit dataset.
